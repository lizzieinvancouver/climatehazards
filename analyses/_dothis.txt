Train back to Montpellier

Starting back up 1 June 2025 (to do items on 13 June 2025):

Stuff to do this visit:
* Simplify the plots (#14)
* Draft the paper!


In September 2024 I suggested I work on (in this order): 
Issues #10 (closed now), #6 (closed now), #13 (mat curves, but almost ready to close)

UPDATE from 23-25 September 2024: 

I suggest I work on (in this order): Issues #10, #6, #13

UPDATE from 2-10 June 2024: 

We finished simulations for mean x variance changes and mostly understand the results! I think, but this depends on how good I wrap up my notes. Is it possible for the Lizzie of today to communicate with the Lizzie of the future? Lizzie of today does her best through new git issues (written below but NOT ONLINE as of 11 June 2024, need to finish). 

- Do these new issues (I set up on git: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/climatehazards/issues):
	Update the endodormancy plots to better months (#11) -- DONE
	Fix the cold days plots (#10) -- DONE
	make the mean warming plots with just north and south latitude -- TO DO!
	make fruit maturation curves (#13) -- DONE 
	simplify towards only a few figures (and simplify figures in general, #14) -- TO DO!
 
To do, but longer time-horizon (listed here ONLY, not in git issues): 
- Prep the figures we may want in paper (including the conceptual ones)
 
Lower priority tasks (listed here ONLY, not in git issues): 
- See log on 25 Sep 2023, where Victor mentions that some projections only have 360 d per year (discussed very briefly in Nov 2023 -- my feeling is that these are currently not a big part of project so whatever he did is FINE). 
- Do the historical PhenoFit runs with 1950-2000 or maybe 1950-1990 (meh, not a priority)
- Fagus simulations future -- to look at LeafDormancyBreakDate see 15 Nov 2023 notes on this.

UPDATE from 26 February 2024: I edited calcclimatesims.R to run one site and one sim (I did not save the edits to calcclimatesims.r to do this, as it is just this:

sitetouse <- 9 # 1 5 9 
# Picked site at latitude 47.5 (5) based on 20 Apr 2023 with Isabelle
# We now also plan to try the most southern and northern site ... which are 1 and 9

if(simstorun=="sims1sd"){
    varchanges <- c(0.5) # c(0, -0.1, 0.1, 0.2)
    tempchanges <- c(0) # c(0, 0.5, 1, 2)
    simshere <- c("sd + 50%")
}

if(simstorun=="sims2mean"){
    varchanges <- c(0) # c(0, -0.1, 0.1, 0.2)
    tempchanges <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # c(0, 0.5, 1, 2)
    simshere <- c("0C", "+1C", "+2C", "+3C", "+4C", "+5")
}


And then looked at TRACE plots in PhenoFit (Capsis).

Then I calcclimatesims.R again (for site 1 and 9) so I had the correct (complete) sims to run the R code for the leafindexplots.

Additional notes on: Plots to get a better sense of leaf damage drivers
Plots to get a better sense of leaf damage drivers (freezing) and when dates are >365.

Thinking on how to do these plots for what is up with leaf index (need days=>365 for leafunfolfing and also days when it was frosty; frosty is harder, so starting there). 
We need then the PHENOFIT output *and* the the climate data ... 

Okay so, for Fagus -- FHminfe (and FHminfl) is -5.3 ... 
Does the climate sim data have any randomness run-to-run to worry about? No, as best I can tell. 

See phenofitleafindexplots.R for progress as of June 2024 (and leafindex_decompose_Fagus.pdf), which includes all species now.
