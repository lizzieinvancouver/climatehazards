UPDATE from 26 February 2024: I edited calcclimatesims.R to run one site and one sim (I did not save the edits to calcclimatesims.r to do this, as it is just this:

sitetouse <- 9 # 1 5 9 
# Picked site at latitude 47.5 (5) based on 20 Apr 2023 with Isabelle
# We now also plan to try the most southern and northern site ... which are 1 and 9

if(simstorun=="sims1sd"){
    varchanges <- c(0.5) # c(0, -0.1, 0.1, 0.2)
    tempchanges <- c(0) # c(0, 0.5, 1, 2)
    simshere <- c("sd + 50%")
}

if(simstorun=="sims2mean"){
    varchanges <- c(0) # c(0, -0.1, 0.1, 0.2)
    tempchanges <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # c(0, 0.5, 1, 2)
    simshere <- c("0C", "+1C", "+2C", "+3C", "+4C", "+5")
}


And then looked at TRACE plots in PhenoFit (Capsis).

Then I calcclimatesims.R again (for site 1 and 9) so I had the correct (complete) sims to run the R code for the leafindexplots.

Do next ... 
Updated December 2023, after November 2023 meeting in person

To do higher priority:
- Plots to get a better sense of leaf damage drivers (freezing) and when dates are >365. We discussed this a lot 15-17 November 2023 (notes in climhazardslog.pdf).
	- I have worked on this! See Additional notes (A) below. 
- Add flowering date and flower dormancy date to all figures? (Note from fall 2023, before Nov 2023 meeting) -- relates to pinusflowerendodormMeanTemp.pdf and other file in same folder, which is a similar task. 
- for projections: moving average AND stitch together the historical and model data (see log of notes). -- done for now, see calcclimatemetricsfuture.R (24 Sep 2023), but waiting on tmx projections. 
- Maybe make historical temperature data a moving average mean, instead of binding by 10 years (could just change the years change code I think and LEAVE everything else -- see how I did it in calcclimatemetricsfuture.R)
 
To do, but longer time-horizon:
- Some day: Fagus simulations future -- to look at LeafDormancyBreakDate see 15 Nov 2023 notes on this.
- Some day: Re-order and consider best plots to show all the phenofit metrics. See notes in log from 17 novembre 2023. 
- Some day: Prep the figures we may want in paper (including the conceptual ones)
- Some day: Do sims where we covary temperature and SD. Which sims? See notes in log from 17 novembre 2023.


Lower priority: 
- See log on 25 Sep 2023, where Victor mentions that some projections only have 360 d per year (discussed very briefly in Nov 2023 -- my feeling is that these are currently not a big part of project so whatever he did is FINE). 
- Do the historical PhenoFit runs with 1950-2000 or maybe 1950-1990 (meh, not a priority)

Additional notes (A) ... Plots to get a better sense of leaf damage drivers

Thinking on how to do these plots for what is up with leaf index (need days=>365 for leafunfolfing and also days when it was frosty; frosty is harder, so starting there). 
We need then the PHENOFIT output *and* the the climate data ... 

Okay so, for Fagus -- FHminfe (and FHminfl) is -5.3 ... 
Does the climate sim data have any randomness run-to-run to worry about? No, as best I can tell. 

See phenofitleafindexplots.R for progress (and leafindex_decompose_Fagus.pdf)
