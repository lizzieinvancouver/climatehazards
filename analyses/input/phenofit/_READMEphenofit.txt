Started 6 April 2023

I need a better way to do this, but for now here is output using the ERA5LAND data from Victor and these species files:
	Fagus_sylvatica_EvolLett2019.species
	Pinus_sylvestris_ADuputie.species
	Quercus_robur_ADuputie.species

On 15 April I deleted what was here (as we switched sites -- I kept the R figures though) and updated to new data.
