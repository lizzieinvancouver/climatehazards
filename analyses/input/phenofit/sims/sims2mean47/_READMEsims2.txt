PhenoFit model using tmn and tmx (and tmp) simulated from detrended climate data. 

Info on this run from: calcclimatemetricssims.R
if(simstorun=="sims2mean"){
    varchanges <- c(0) # c(0, -0.1, 0.1, 0.2)
    tempchanges <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # c(0, 0.5, 1, 2)
    simshere <- c("0C", "+1C", "+2C", "+3C", "+4C", "+5")
}


All the other data (including PET) was just repeated.
