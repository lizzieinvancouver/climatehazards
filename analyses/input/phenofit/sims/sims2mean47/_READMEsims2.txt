QUICK update 21 June 2023 -- NEED to update this file!!!!

PhenoFit model using tmn and tmx (and tmp) with different mean (only):
I did not save these R files, but they are the same as in:
Commit 1664d09418e82e3afefddc4a32a75dd58ec6e1a7 with the following change:

varchanges <- c(0) # c(0, -0.1, 0.1, 0.2)
tempchanges <- c(0, 1, 2) # c(0, 0.5, 1, 2)

Fakelon for each treatment and the treatment:

1 	0 mean
2 	1 mean
3 	2 mean

Given this is the same size files as for the SD changes today, I only re-ran calcclimatemetricssims.R (not otherfilesformatforsims.R also). 
All the other data (including PET) was just repeated.
