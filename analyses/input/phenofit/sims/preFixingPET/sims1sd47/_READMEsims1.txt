PhenoFit model using tmn and tmx (and tmp) simulated from detrended climate data. 

Info on this run from: calcclimatemetricssims.R

if(simstorun=="sims1sd"){
    varchanges <- c(-0.5, -0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.5) # c(0, -0.1, 0.1, 0.2)
    tempchanges <- c(0) # c(0, 0.5, 1, 2)
    simshere <- c("sd -50%", "sd -25%", "sd 0%", "sd + 25", "sd + 50%")
}

All the other data (including PET) was just repeated.
