Extras/pinusflowerendodormMeanTemp.pdf -- put together these compare the SD sims climate (pinusflowerendodormMeanTemp.pdf, which has the endodormancy curve for flowering layered on, but the height is meaningless) and the endodormanyc results (pinusflowerendodorm).

prefixingPET/ -- just what it sounds like, results before I updated our PET to match the climate of our future sims.

querob_cmaes_fit_subset2_rep2/ and
querob_Duputie/ are Querob results using different species parameter files. See docs/ folder for whole PDF on these issues.
