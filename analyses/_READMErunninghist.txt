How to run the historical data (based on my memory from earlier this year when I knew what I was doing and doing it yesterday) 

1) Run phenofit (for three species).

	cd /Applications/Capsis/
	sh capsis.sh -l en

Select the appropriate species file. 

Set the years to 1950-2020.

Select analyes/input/ERALAND as the climate folder (and remember that you just select the folder in the phenofit GUI, you do not click into it). 

2) I then manually move output to input/phenofit and the various folders.
