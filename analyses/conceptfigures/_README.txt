makeWEcurves.R is copied from vassal-hen/analyses/wangengel/maketalkcurve.R with some minor edits by me so far -- UPDATE THIS file (do not create a new file) to make curves

Script_functions_pheno_models.R -- also copied from same place; you need to source it, but should not need to edit it.

For the parameters, set the minimum to 0 and max to 40, and the optimum to:
26 for budburst
29 for flowering
21.5 for veraison
These values for from lab paper Morales-Castilla et al. 2020 (Table S4). 

How much has it warmed? 
- We should get our colleague Ben Cook to help with this; for now:
6 to 6.75 for budburst
20 to 21.5 for flowering 
16 to 17 for veraison

* I should also ask Isabelle about why the WE are sharp ... seems to be the alpha. 
* Once we have a draft done, remind me to CONTACT Ben.
