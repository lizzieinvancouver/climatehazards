DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION

------------------------



ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.00003.001



Name: Triple aspirated air temperature



Description: Air temperature, available as one- and thirty-minute averages derived from triplicate 1 Hz temperature observations. Observations are made by sensors located at the top of the tower infrastructure. Temperature observations are made by three platinum resistance thermometers, which are housed together in a fan aspirated shield to reduce radiative biases.



NEON Science Team Supplier: Terrestrial Instrument System



Abstract: Triple aspirated air temperature measurements, available as one- and thirty-minute averages of 1 Hz observations. Temperature is one of the most fundamental physical measurements. It is a primary driving factor for countless physical, chemical, and biological processes. The triple aspirated sensor assembly comprises three individual Platinum Resistance Thermometers (PRTs) housed within an aspirated shield.

Latency:
Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.



Brief Design Description: The Triple Aspirated Air Temperature assembly is deployed at core and relocatable tower sites. It is located on the top level of the tower infrastructure.

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------

NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via NEON's data portal or API. Please visit https://www.neonscience.org/data-formats-conventions for a full description of the naming conventions.

ISSUE LOG

----------



This log provides a list of issues that were identified during data collection or processing, prior to publication of this data package. For a more recent log, please visit this data product's detail page at https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00003.001.



Issue Date: 2022-09-13
Issue: Severe flooding destroyed several roads into Yellowstone National Park in June 2022, making the YELL and BLDE sites inaccessible to NEON staff. Preventive and corrective maintenance are not being performed, nor is the annual exchange of sensors for calibration and validation. While automated quality control routines are likely to detect and flag most issues, users are advised to review data carefully.
       Date Range: 2022-06-12 to 2022-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: YELL
Resolution Date: 
Resolution: 

Issue Date: 2022-01-10
Issue: Erratic data not caught by autoflagging
       Date Range: 2021-06-30 to 2021-06-30
       Location(s) Affected: OSBS (HOR.VER: 000.060)
Resolution Date: 2022-01-10
Resolution: Manual flagging applied

Issue Date: 2022-01-18
Issue: Data were reprocessed to incorporate minor and/or isolated corrections to quality control thresholds, sensor installation periods, geolocation data, and manual quality flags.
       Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2021-10-01
       Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2022-01-01
Resolution: Reprocessed provisional data are available now. Reprocessed data previously included in RELEASE-2021 will become available when RELEASE-2022 is issued.

Issue Date: 2021-01-11
Issue: Safety measures to protect personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced or canceled maintenance activities for extended periods at NEON sites. Data availability and/or quality may be negatively impacted during this time.

In addition, the annual refresh of sensors and data acquisition systems (DAS) did not occur according to the typical 1-year schedule for many sites. The annual refresh is where freshly calibrated and verified sensors and DAS replace the units in the field.
       Date Range: 2020-03-23 to 2021-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: ALL
Resolution Date: 2021-12-31
Resolution: NEON reviewed data from all sites and time periods potentially impacted by COVID-19 safety precautions to identify and manually flag suspect data that escaped automated quality tests. Suspect data are indicated by the final quality flag in the data files, which should be used to inform data filtering prior to use. 

Currently, there are no quality flags indicating lack of conformance to an annual sensor refresh interval, but these are in development. Data during this time period should be treated as valid unless marked suspect by other quality flags.

Issue Date: 2020-01-08
Issue: The alpha and beta quality metric multipliers used for computing the final quality flag were swapped in processing. The final quality flag is raised when alphaQM*m + betaQM*n >= 20%. The multiplier m should be set to 2 and n should be set to 1, but these values were swapped, making it slightly harder to raise the final quality flag. These multipliers were corrected in data produced after the resolution date. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release. An additional changelog comment will be entered at that time.
       Date Range: 2020-01-08 to 2020-01-08
       Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2020-06-10
Resolution: 2020-01-08: Processing code updated in forward processing.
2020-06-10: All data reprocessed with corrected algorithm.

Issue Date: 2020-03-26
Issue: Coefficients used in IS data processing to compute the uncertainty contributed by resistance or voltage readings made by the field data acquisition system (FDAS) were updated. The updated coefficients are based on a larger FDAS sample and are larger than previous estimates. Although the difference between previous uncertainty estimates and updated estimates is small, there may be periods for which the FDAS uncertainty represents the largest source of uncertainty. Data produced after the resolution date have been produced with the updated coefficients. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release. An additional changelog comment will be entered at that time.
       Date Range: 2019-12-11 to 2019-12-11
       Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2020-06-10
Resolution: 2019-12-11: Updated coefficients used in processing.
2020-06-10: All data reprocessed with correct coefficients.

Issue Date: 2020-06-10
Issue: All data were reprocessed with the most recent algorithms, quality control thresholds, and/or other metadata to improve overall data coverage and quality. Notes have been added to the logs of previously identified issues that have been corrected.
       Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2020-06-10
