phenofitsims/ folder contains output written in calcclimatemetricssims.R
I overwrite these files EVERY time so don't look for different simulations. 

simsRformat/ I write out the output for the simulated data (currently temperature) in R formats

These are the output of all the phenofit sims after processing in R (phenofitplotsims.R and phenofitplotsimsmeanvar.R)
onemeandf.csv
onemeansddf.csv
onesddf.csv


Looking for the output of PHENOFIT using simulated data? 
climatehazards/analyses/input/phenofit (this makes sense since it is not R output)
