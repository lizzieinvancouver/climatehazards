Started 4 July 2023
Victor sent the GCM projections

First (27 Jun 2023) he sent: 

recdVictor_scenarios/CMIP6_adjust/ssp245 (currently called: ssp245_2023June)

Meanwhile, here's the future temperature data for the scenario ssp245

MRI GCmodel is missing, but I will send it to you later - as well as the scenario ss585 (to keep everyone happy!).
Be aware I did not run any simulation with these min/max projections, so check if everything is ok.

And then (29 June 2023) he sent:
"Here's the missing MRI simulations" which was folder MRI-ESM2-0 (which I put in the scenario folder)

27 August 2023 he sent updated ssp245 -- which should have more years so we can compare to historical data, email was: "Here's the new link to download the data (except MRI GCM)" ... currently in:

recdVictor_scenarios/ssp245_2023Aug

Analyses/input/ssp245 is now the JUNE plus AUGUST 2023 updated data except for MRI-ESM2-0, which I never seem to have written code for anyway (and only have from June 2023).


And on 24 Oct 2023: he wrote: 

"I formatted the higher warming scenario data, you can download them here: https://filesender.renater.fr/?s=download&token=3c9293cb-562e-4d08-bd70-2ebc3330d33e
Let me know if everything is OK. I kept each original model calendar (either true gregorian or 365-day).
Note that I did not include UKESM because of the 360-day calendar, but it will be quite straightforward to add it (with or without interpolation)."

Currently they are in: 

recdVictor_scenarios/ssp585_2023Oct
