Started 4 July 2023
Victor sent the GCM projections

First (27 Jun 2023) he sent: 

Meanwhile, here's the future temperature data for the scenario ssp245

MRI GCmodel is missing, but I will send it to you later - as well as the scenario ss585 (to keep everyone happy!).
Be aware I did not run any simulation with these min/max projections, so check if everything is ok.

And then (29 June 2023) he sent:
"Here's the missing MRI simulations" which was folder MRI-ESM2-0 (which I put in the scenario folder)
