Trying to install Phenofit

From Isabelle on java installation: https://capsis.cirad.fr/capsis/documentation/faq

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64788005/java-jdk-for-the-apple-silicon-chips

Go to directory ... Phenofit4_Standalone (this is the FIRST folder that she gave me)  
java -jar phenofit4.setup.jar

phenofitsetup.jar is the SECOND file she gave me.
I think capsis.jar is the LAST one ... use whichever one is the last one. 

One of these SHOULD work on a PC. You may need to restart Capsis to get it to not freeze the first time.

Step 1 (updated by Lizzie on 27 Feb 2023):

In Terminal:

cd /Applications/Capsis/
sh capsis.sh -l en

Once you have the installation done, go to the folder in Terminal:
Type 'capsis' at the prompt and it should launch.
- Creer nouveau project
- New pop-up window and you can name it if you want; but you don't have to as it will save automatically (it writes out output and appends it automatically).
- Then you click initialize. 
- New pop up requires species parameter file. 
    Species box
	- You should have in your phenofit folder: SVN_files -> Species -> then you can select a species to try (.species files)
	- You can skip 'dates dives par fichier'
    Climate Box
	- SVN_files -> climate ... You should also have some climate files to play with (not very much, but enough to try out). You need at least min/max temperature and then maybe EVT (and then it calculate everything else) ... sounds like this (or next) version she calculates a lot of the climate files outside Phenofit
	- SVN_files -> climate -> N2 folders are different ways of calculating daily climate data (she uses N2_PenmanBacleau usually) ... pick the directory for the climatic data (e.g., N2_PenmanBacleau)
	- Pick which way your lat/long is (usually WS854) -- this will calculate the photoperiod
	- You can restrict the geographical zone (but then you need a file with the coordinates set up)
	- SKIP activer le temperature moyenne
     Next Box
	- Start the year before the event ALWAYS (meaning the year here should be the first year of climate data; but you will only get the output data starting with the following year because you need climate data from the year before to start the model)
	- Always select 'activer l'esport a la vollee' -- this gives you the output (otherwise you can try to get it from exporting the last year of results on the next screen)
	- You can also change the folder here that it writes out to ... it's set to tmp now. 
	- Next it will ask about 'clearing output directory' (tmp) -- overwriting should be okay if you picked a good directory to write out files 
	- 'Activer l'ecriture' will give you for one year x one site (which you need to identify) all the internal output (otherwise 
- Then you click go or something (I missed this)
- Output you get all the variables as separate files! 
	- Tempsurvival is lethal temperature and the whole tree dies, but if just buds die (as they do), then you see it in the LAI output file. 


Misc:
- Local files should be just that -- files on your computer
	- Lots of other species, but files not checked as well. 
- SVN_files should be server versions. 
- You can launch as many runs as you want. 

Leafindex:
(From Isabelle on 19 March 2023): I found LeafIndex : it is the leafIndex at the end of the season, the day before senescence date, so it integrates all frost damages since bud set (or almost).

<> Formatting input climate data for PHENOFIT4 <>
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

You must always have 4 comment lines before climate data. 

You need daily data for these variables: 
Tmin (tmn)
tmax (tmx)
Tmean (tmp)
Pet (pet)
Precip (pre)

PLUS two constant site features: 
altitude 
WHC
