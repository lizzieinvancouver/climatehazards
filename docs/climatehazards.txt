Thinking on climate hazards project with Isabelle

<><><><><><><><><>
What did I propose?
Seasonal pressure points of climate change see git/grants/misc/sabbatical2022/fulbright2021.pdf

- Build a year-round phenological model
- Compare what gets better with longer seasons and warmer winters versus losses due to cold (spring/fall?) and heat damage. 

Isabelle said to just do it with PhenoFit versus re-invent the wheel. 

Best ref for Phenofit is Chuine & Beaubien 2001:
"PHENOFIT is based on different process-based models: phenological models (Chuine 2000), a frost-injury model (Leinonen 1996), a survival model and a reproductive success model."

Maybe be careful to think through what we'd dream to do, then figure out a good (and interesting on its own) FIRST step. Then clearly outline what else we would like to do. 

Questions for Isabelle:

- Seems like a lot of this might be done already in Phenofit, but no one has focused on the events versus mean warming -- is that correct?
- Phenofit very focused on survival (at bud level? At what level?) -- and how to translate to fitness metric such as seeds produced (instead of dead/alive). 
- Is there a model for winegrapes we can use? Does it include hardiness (my guess is no; it seems a sharp threshold model)?
- Other resources to read about PhenoFit?

Misc questions for Isabelle:
- REALM project by Prentice to introduce eco-evolutionary optimality (EEO) such as https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16459 (meh) and in Organizing principles for vegetation dynamics (https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02615052/document) and Eco-evolutionary optimality as a means to improve vegetation and land-surface models (https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17558) which both seem to lay out the idea

Other ideas

-> Run some non-phenology data through phenoFit

-> Tension between over-identified models like phenofit/STICS etc. and simpler ones (wha I was proposing sort of).... As an example here's STICS for winegrapes: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16493 and compare that to the paper Nacho published. 

-> Finish callose stuff.

** MAKE sure to min and max RH ** 

- Detrending removes trends in central tendency 
- Use detrended data for long-term baseline
	(1) Z-score them
	(2) Then multiple the SD by 1.2 for a 20% increase in variability *normal distribution 
	(3) Check your output 
- ET
	- if you have relative humidity and temperature, then that's enough 
	- Use this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation#August%E2%80%93Roche%E2%80%93Magnus_formula
	- This is how Ben typically does it
	- Need: max RH and min RH (and temperature)
	- Remember: Tmax is associated Tmin RH (and vice versa)
	- RH tells you how saturated the air is; use temperature to calculate how much water the air is
	- Step 1: Put in the August Roche Magnus -- hypothetical maximum (e_s) using just T -- see the link: Basically it's 6.1^((17.625*T)/(T+234))
	- Step 2: Now multiple e_s by RH: e_S*(RH)
	- (Make relative RH is measured as a fraction)
	- Now you have the ET!
	- Check with an online calculator! Or check that every degree warmer get about a 7% increase. 

(2) Good question, Ben does not know.
