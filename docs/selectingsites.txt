Selecting sites


<><><><><><><><><>
Looking at Fig S0 in Duputie et al. 2015 I then went to google maps and selected:

9 sites from mid Italy to lower part of Sweden, trying to not pick sites that were too close to the coast  (note that mid-Italy may not have PINSYL and upper regions of Sweden do not have QUEPET but QUEROB appears to go further north)

43.038560, 11.846579 (Siena Provence, Italy)
45.357721, 9.896506 (east of Milan)
47.290201, 8.256797 (between Zurich and Lucerne)
49.172526, 8.968161 (north of Stuttgart, looks flat)
51.359586, 10.028342 (east of Kassel, flat-ish)
53.092191, 10.275534 (south of Hamburg)
56.061279, 13.557157 (north of Malmo, big jump as otherwise it's Denmark for these latitudes)
57.609649, 14.435134 (Sweden)
59.171276, 14.398552 (Sweden)

Could also do a transect through France to UK ... but I suspect that would not include so much climate variability so I picked this one. 

Historical climate (ideally 1950-2020) and one 20 year climate projection (something similar to +2 C perhaps?) for these sites 

43.038560, 11.846579 
45.357721, 9.896506 
47.290201, 8.256797 
49.172526, 8.968161
51.359586, 10.028342 
53.092191, 10.275534 
56.061279, 13.557157
57.609649, 14.435134
59.171276, 14.398552

Update 5 avril 2023

Victor asked why no sites in more continental Europe where variability might be higher. I looked at Duputie supp and agreed, so I am picking three more. Fagus is the most limited here so I am checking also this: https://forest.jrc.ec.europa.eu/media/atlas/Fagus_sylvatica.pdf

52.877881, 17.306702 - slightly northern Poland 
50.508674, 21.833069 - slightly southern Poland 
46.614127, 24.206116 - trying to pick a not hilly part of Romania
