% A lot of this and the historical and mean warming results taken from 23 juin 2023 log notes to start with. 

\section{Historical trends}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Fagus} is determined mainly by FruitIndex (related to frost damage). 
\item \emph{Pinus} survival dominates (due to carbon problems which comes from not enough chilling.) 
\item \emph{Quercus} is determined mainly MaturationIndex (does not mature in time) a little, but mostly it is fine. 
\end{itemize}

  \caption{These results build through the multiplicative components of fitness (which are multiplied together): Survival (left), Survival$*$FruitIndex (middle) and Fitness, which is Survival$*$FruitIndex*MaturationIndex (right). Given high survival and little change between the middle and right panels we can see that \emph{Fagus} is determined mainly by FruitIndex (this makes sense as it is often affected by frost damage, having a low tolerance of low temperatures). We see next the for \emph{Pinus} survival dominates (often it does not meet the chill requirement for leafout and thus has no carbon and low CarbonSurvival so low total Survival) and finally, for \emph{Quercus} it's MaturationIndex (this makes sense as the fruits are quite large and can take a long time to mature---it doesn't always happen according to this model). }

\section{Overview of warming simulation results}

\subsection{\emph{Fagus} warming results}
Next the mean warming simulations. In understanding \emph{Fagus} results (Fig. \ref{fig:fagusmean3}) we discussed how we could see that at low latitudes (Fig. \ref{fig:fagusmean41}) that there was reduced CarbonSurvival (not enough cold means late dormancy) and thus FruitMaturationDate gets later. While at higher latitudes (Fig. \ref{fig:fagusmean53} ) there is an increase in the FruitIndex as FruitMaturation is higher.

In June 2023, we discussed: at low latitudes (see next figure) that there was reduced CarbonSurvival (not enough cold means late dormancy) and thus FruitMaturationDate gets later. While at higher latitudes (see Fig. \ref{fig:fagusmean53}) there is an increase in the FruitIndex as FruitMaturation is higher.}

  \caption{\emph{Fagus} across 0 (1) to $+$5 (6) mean warming across fitness components at 53\degree N latitude. Here's warming reduces frost and thus fruitindex goes up (less flowering damage probably) and survival goes up. MatIndex also goes up (likely due to a mix of leafindex going up and there is a direct effect of temperature on MatIndex). Note that the leafdormancybreakdate also gets a little later but leafunfolding does not because the warming is still enough for get earlier leafout (and there is a buffer where early dormancybreakdate does not matter because it's too cold leaf unfolding to start. }

\subsection{For our mean results for  \emph{Pinus}}...
... it looks like carbon could be the issue again, which is close to 0 (minimum is 0.1 in PhenoFit for C survival) at low latitudes and declines with warming at the higher latitude. Check out dormancybreakdates which show that it must not get enough chilling.

\section{Overview of SD simulation results}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Fagus} is determined mainly by a combo of damage to leaves and flowers, which increases with increasing variance. 
\item \emph{Pinus} survival dominates at low latitudes (no carbon survival and variance does not change this), but at highest latitude variance also leads to later leafout (low chill, later dormancy break) and thus lower leafindex (note that Pinus can sustain VERY low temperatures and is unlikely to have frost damage). 
\item \emph{Quercus} is not changing much but does see some frost losses at higher variance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Predictions for SD x mean warming!}

\emph{Short update from 7 June:} When we discussed this, we felt most predictions were vaguely correct to varying degrees. See the section following and review the results to confirm. 

Victor and Lizzie made predictions for what we will see in simulations of increased warming crossed with -0.5 and $+0.5$ increases in variance. Lizzie added the take-home message that goes with each genus \emph{after} the meeting). 

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Quercus}: some positive and negative effects of more variance depending on whether warming is high or low
\begin{itemize}
\item No effects of increased variance at all of higher warming because no more frost damage, but ...
\item At lower levels of warming and increased variance may start to see lower survival due to frost damage. 
\item However, we may see that later dormancy date break actually becomes a problem, but probably not as even at southern site the dormancy break date is not too late.
\end{itemize}
\item \emph{Pinus}: Variance and warming compound to lead to greater negative effects. 
\begin{itemize}
\item More variance and more warming will lead to even greater issues with dormancy break dates and thus lower carbon survival. Small chance of non-linear responses for warming x variance at northern site.
\item Less variance will not change the negative results of increased warming, and like may even make it worse as possibly the curve moves out of getting much chill at all rapidly. 
\end{itemize}
\item \emph{Fagus}: Results depend on latitude, but include variance and warming compounding to greater positive effects. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Site 41 N: Increase variance could reduce negative effects of late dormancy somewhat, also less frost with increased warming x increased variance so high warming and high variance could lead to positive effects (more positive than either change alone)
\item Site 53 N: increased variance problems (frost) go away when combined with increased warming (also, it's always easy to reach dormancy accumulation at this site)
\item Added 6 June 2024: Lower variance could increase negative effects of warming at southern site. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

We also discussed how important the endodormancy curves are to predictions; because basically warming moves out of low temperatures needed for chilling.

Also, given we're not sure about the endodormancy curves (perhaps especially for Quercus, which has quite a wide endodormancy curve) we should not make predictions specifically about these species, but more generally about responses to shifting mean and variance. 

\section{Results for SD x mean warming}
\emph{These results come from work on 6-7 June 2024, while Lizzie was in Montpellier and may not yet be fully and perfectly digested.} Also, I was pretty exhausted during this meeting so take them with a grain of salt. Plots are meansdsimallmetricsFSlat41.pdf etc.. See also `Overview of June 2024 in Montpellier' in the log for a few take home messages from around 4pm on a Friday. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Quercus}: some positive and negative effects of more variance depending on whether warming is high or low
\begin{itemize}
\item At site 41: Flowering is earlier for higher variance, but very similar and no earlier mat date. Dormancy break date is later, but does not seem to lead to later flowering, and also does not affect fitness. Basically all fine (lower fitness a TINY bit for lower warming x higher variance).  At 53 N: higher variance, lower warming leads to some frost but not much.
\end{itemize}
\item \emph{Pinus}: Variance and warming compound to lead to greater negative effects. Or, as we said on the 7th, ``everything is bad.''
\item \emph{Fagus}
\begin{itemize}
\item Site 41 N: Low variance is better except at high warming where there are issues with late breaking.
\item Site 53 N: Increased variance is constantly worse, but increased warming leads to less frost. Fruit maturation stalls (even though flowering advances) though it appears to have no or low impact on fitness. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Some reminders for Lizzie... }
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimum carbon survival is 0.1. 
\item Pinus can sustain VERY low temperatures and is unlikely to have frost damage
\item Fagus and Quercus have mixed buds (so flower endodormancy should be the same as leaf endodormancy).
\item Temperature survival really does not matter. See 7 June 2024 log notes.
\item Drought survival should not matter as we do not change the water in the soil (WHC) or the precip. 
\end{itemize}
